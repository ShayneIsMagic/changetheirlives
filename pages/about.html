                    his wealth of experience. It represents a harmonious blend
                    of entrepreneurial success, rock star team building, and a
                    dedication to giving back to the community. Jason is not
                    only focused on the success of his ventures but also on
                    creating passion and excellence in others. His journey as an

                  <p>
                    Extensive training and development experience in both
                    industry and education I understand what it takes to help
                    people learn so they can be more successful.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Elearning is my sweet spot as I have developed several
                    online learning programs from start to finish. I see how
                    valuable it can be, if implemented correctly.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The ability to build and develop organizations. I've managed
                    and created both large and small teams, virtually and
                    face-to-face. I know and understand the skills needed to be
                    successful and how to inspire others to work hard and work
                    together.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The ability to motivate for success. As a manager and
                    business owner, I work hard to implement processes that
                    remove co-worker roadblocks while enabling and encouraging
                    their best work. Some of these involve better scheduling
                    practices, developing redundant skill sets in team members,
                    employee advancement opportunities, and better client
                    awareness.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Strong business acumen (My experience includes a little over
                    a decade managing my own business). I understand the
                    importance of the bottom line and what it takes to achieve
                    profitability. *Driven professional...Solid work
