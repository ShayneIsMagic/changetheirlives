            <p>
              Hello everyone! My name is Amee Brisk, before starting at
              DevPipeline I was a stay-at-home mom and was looking into going
              back to school. I had very limited knowledge of software
              develepment and coding skills. Since starting with DevPipeline I
              have learned a lot about myself and have gained so much knowledge.
              Every day I am learning new things and taking on new challenges.
              DevPipeline is one of the most positive teamwork environments that
              I have had the priviledge to work in. They encourage us to learn
              and not be afraid to fail in the process. Accepting the
              oppurtunity to learn and work for DevPipeline has made a great
              impact on my life.
